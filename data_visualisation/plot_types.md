# Plot Types
## Line Plot
- Line plots are used to track changes over short and long periods of time. When smaller changes exist, line plots are better to use than bar graphs. Line plots can also be used to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group.
- Line plots are often used to represent time series data. In a time series, time is often the independent variable and the goal is usually to detect trends over time.
- Line plots are also used to compare two or more variables. For example, you can compare the sales of different products by year.

## Bar Plot
- Bar plots are used to compare different groups. One axis of the plot shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value.
- Bar plots are useful for comparing data that is classified into categories. They are also useful for comparing data across categories.
- Bar plots are also used to compare data across different time periods.

## Histogram
- Histograms are used to show the distribution of a single variable. Each bar in a histogram represents the frequency of data points in a certain range.
- Histograms are useful when you want to see how your data is distributed across different categories.
- Histograms are also used to compare the distribution of data across different categories.

## Scatter Plot
- Scatter plots are used to show the relationship between two variables. Each dot in a scatter plot represents a single data point.
- Scatter plots are useful when you want to see how two variables are related to each other.
- Scatter plots are also used to identify trends in data.

## Violin Plot
- Violin plots are used to show the distribution of a single variable. They are similar to box plots, but they also show the probability density of the data at different values.
- Violin plots are useful when you want to see how your data is distributed across different categories.
- Violin plots are also used to compare the distribution of data across different categories.

## Box Plot
- Box plots are used to show the distribution of a single variable. They are useful for comparing the distribution of data across different categories.
- Box plots are also used to identify outliers in the data.
- Box plots are also used to compare the distribution of data across different categories.

## Kernel Density Plot
- Kernel density plots are used to show the distribution of a single variable. They are similar to histograms, but they show the probability density of the data at different values.
- Kernel density plots are useful when you want to see how your data is distributed across different categories.
- Kernel density plots are also used to compare the distribution of data across different categories.

## Heatmap
- Heatmaps are used to show the relationship between two variables. They are useful for visualizing large amounts of data.
- Heatmaps are useful when you want to see how two variables are related to each other.
- Heatmaps are also used to identify trends in data.
